CV_1.2 contains the code for the computer vision assignment. It detects the aruco marker and caluclates the angle between the z and x axis. This then gets printed on the LCD screen. To set this up, the webcam and lcd screen must both be connected to the raspberry pi.

workingDEMOcode contains the code used for the localization and controls portion of demo 1. This code works by the user inputting the desired angle and the desired distance for the robot to travel. It utilizes a state machine to transition between phases of straight line travel and rotational. In the current configuration, if an angle other than 0 is inputted, then the robot will turn to that angle first, then travel the desired straight line distance. The straight line and rotational functions are controlled by having a specific voltage being sent to the motors. When turning it will send the code to one motor with a positive value, while the other motor will be sent a negative value, Vdelta and -Vdelta. This spins the motors in opposite direction, enabling the robot to turn. The straight line apsect uses the voltage Vsum and send this to both motors. Both Vsum and Vdelta were created using 2 PI controllers for each. Vsum uses PI controllers for both linear speed and position, while Vdelta uses PI controllers for the angle and angular speed.
