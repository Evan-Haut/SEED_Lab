The Rasberry Pi Code serves to detect the aruco marker and then send the distance and angle to the marker to the arduino. It then sends these angles over I2C to the arduino
which then controls the motors. It detects the markers via the openCV library, then uses a calibrated matrix to flatten the image and find the distance and angle.

Demo3Circumnavigate contains the code used for the localization and controls portion of demo3. The main objective of this code is to make the robot go within 1ft of 
the beacon and circle it within 3 inches of its starting position. It works by initially continuously rotating clockwise in a circle. This is caused by sending opposing
sign voltages to each motor, until the beacon has been detected. Once the beacon is found by the camera, the Pi then tells the arduino to stop turning, the desired angle
of correction between the camera and beacon, and distance to the beacon, through the sending of bits. It will the turn the necessary correction angle and drive within
1ft of the beacon. Then it will send opposing voltages again to the motors, turning 90 degrees. Once, this turn is complete, the motors will spin with same sign
voltages but at different magnitudes. This allowed the robot to create a circular path arounf the beacon until it has reached its full distance, which is within 3 inches
of its starting point. Once this has been completed, iot reaches its final state, the stop state, and its journey is now concluded.
